# Analytics Portfolio

Hello and welcome to a curated selection of analytics projects Iâ€™ve worked on over the past three years!  

My goal here is to strike a balance: diving deep enough to showcase my analytical skills while avoiding overwhelming you with too many projects. To that end, Iâ€™ve handpicked one project from each "field" of analytics Iâ€™ve worked in, reflecting the diverse hats Iâ€™ve worn in my career.

## A Bit About My Journey  
In a startup environment, versatility is keyâ€”and even before my time at Klein, my analytical experiences were varied. Iâ€™ve tackled projects ranging from glioblastoma cell death rates and atrazine concentrations in water (where I collected and analyzed the data myself) to large-scale datasets I didnâ€™t collect, such as dietary data on humans, financial projections, user behaviors, and more.

My toolkit has evolved over time. Early in my career, rooted in academia, I relied heavily on Excel and R. During my graduate studies at ASU, I developed a working knowledge of Python to keep pace with my peers. Later, at Klein, I honed skills in SQL and Tableau to support scalable databases as we prepare to grow our data science department with an expanding user base.
