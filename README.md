# Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to a curated selection of analytics projects Iâ€™ve worked on over the past three years!  

My goal is to showcase my analytical skills while keeping things concise. Iâ€™ve handpicked one project from each "field" of analytics Iâ€™ve worked in, reflecting the diverse roles Iâ€™ve taken on in my career.

## A Bit About My Journey  
In a startup environment like Klein Training, versatility is key. My analytical journey began in academia, where I collected and analyzed data myself on projects like glioblastoma cell death rates and atrazine concentrations in water. Iâ€™ve since worked with unfamiliar datasets I did not collect, such as financial projections and user behaviors, as well as large-scale data on dietary trends and more.

My toolkit has evolved over time. Early on, I relied on Excel and R. During my graduate studies at ASU, I developed Python skills to keep pace with peers. At Klein Training, I honed SQL and Tableau expertise to support scalable databases as we prepare to grow our data science department with an expanding user base.
