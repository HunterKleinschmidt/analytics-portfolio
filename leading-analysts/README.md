# Leading Analysts at Klein Training

As Lead Data Analyst at Klein Training, I guided a team of data science interns through impactful analytics projects in a dynamic startup setting. My leadership blended technical mentorship with strategic oversight, delivering tools and insights that fueled data-driven decisions—all while navigating the confidentiality and ambiguity of a private company.

Below are three projects spanning 2023–2024 that highlight my management approach, from defining objectives to driving results.
