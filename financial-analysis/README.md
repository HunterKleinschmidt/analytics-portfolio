# Financial Analysis for Investor Pitch

## Reflections on Bias and Ethics

This project stretched my understanding of bias and ethics in data analysis and presentation. Tasked with creating financial projections to secure $30,000 from investors after our fitness app’s pilot campaign, we faced a critical question: where’s the line between letting the data tell our story and using it to craft a narrative? We’re not Facebook with skyrocketing numbers, but there *is* promise in our results. The challenge was to showcase that potential—doing justice to our pilot data—without crossing into bias. Balancing transparency with persuasion taught me the importance of grounding projections in reality while still inspiring confidence, a lesson I carry into all my analytical work.

## Overview

This financial analysis project supported a successful pitch to raise $30,000 from investors following our fitness app’s initial pilot campaign. It leverages pilot data—user subscriptions, engagement metrics, and revenue—to build projections that estimate growth, profitability, and scalability. Using Python and Excel, I analyzed historical trends, modeled future scenarios, and prepared visualizations to communicate potential to stakeholders. The project highlights my ability to derive actionable insights from limited data while navigating the ethical complexities of financial storytelling.
