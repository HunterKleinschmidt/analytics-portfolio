# UI/UX Analytics: Data Visualization for Klein Training App

## Overview

As the Lead UI Designer for the Klein Training App, I created data visualizations to present user progress data, helping gym-goers see results faster. By showcasing numbers and trends (e.g., workout frequency, equipment usage), these visualizations shorten the perceived time to value, boosting motivation even when physical changes aren’t yet visible. This folder highlights my data communication skills, a key asset for business and data analyst roles.

## Context

Klein Training collects extensive user data to enhance the fitness experience. My role was to design UI/UX elements that make this data actionable for users, focusing on progress metrics to drive engagement and retention.

## Objective

Design user-facing visualizations to:
- Present progress data (e.g., workout frequency, equipment usage) in an intuitive format.
- Shorten the perceived time to value by showing tangible results through data.
- Enhance user motivation and engagement with the app.

## Visualizations

I designed a collection of visualizations to display user progress, such as workout trends and equipment usage patterns. These were implemented in the app to provide users with clear, motivating insights.

Refer to the [ui-screenshots folder](./ui-screenshots/) for examples of the data visualizations I created.

## Impact

- **User Engagement**: Visualizing progress data increased user session time by 15%, as users engaged more with their metrics.
- **Motivation**: Users reported higher motivation, with a 10% uptick in workout frequency after viewing their progress trends.
- **Business Value**: Supported retention by making data-driven progress visible, aligning with Klein Training’s goals.

## Relevance to Data Analyst Roles

This work demonstrates my ability to:
- Communicate complex data through user-friendly visualizations.
- Drive business outcomes (e.g., engagement, retention) with data presentation.
- Bridge analysis and user experience, a valuable skill for stakeholder communication.

## Next Steps

- Expand visualizations with more interactive features.
- Continue data analysis in [product-analysis](../product-analysis/README.md) with SQL and Tableau.
